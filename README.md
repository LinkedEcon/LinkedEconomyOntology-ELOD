# LinkedEconomyOntology (e-LOD)

# Introduction

In this repository the Linked Economy Ontology can be found which has been used for the modeling of each data source. Specifically the Classes, the Object and Data Type Properties of the ontologies are presented and described. As example, SPARQL queries are provided along with a sample of their responses. For user's convenience the overall Linked Economy Ontology has been divided per data source. 

# How to use 

For each of the modeled data source a folder can be found which contains two files regarding the specific data source: 
<br> a) the OWL file of the Ontology, and 
<br> b) a document (Cookbook) presenting and describing the Classes, the Object and Data Type Properties of the Ontology while providing SPARQL queries as examples.
<br><br>
The user is encouraged to study the documents of the Ontology in order to get a better insight of it. The provided SPARQL queries and their results, along with the knowledge gained by the Cookbook, are sufficient in order to provide the basic means for creating custom queries to the graph.
